## THE BLOG IS LIVE!!!!!!
This this took **so long**, genuinely. I wanted a way for my blog posts to be rendered from
files so I wouldn't constantly have to kill myself with the html code. I went through a lot
of attempts of this. I tried text to html and rendered that on the page but that was super
over complicated. I tried xml. I tried markdown to html the file through javascript but that
took forever. All these methods created unnecessary files and relied on caching which was also
awful. Eventually I actually just settled on rendering all the markdown files contentsinto raw
html (like just the p tags and content) and inserting that into divs. It didn't realize 
genuinely how fast javascript could convert that. This is what it is now! It has no styling
because I'm lazy and don't want to open a whole other can of worms. I will update it in the
future, but for now this will be a blog for my thoughts, ideas, and maybe even essays I write
about stuff I care about. **Thank you for looking :)**
