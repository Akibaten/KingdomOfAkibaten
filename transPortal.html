                Being trans is hard and confusing and weird. I'm extremely passionate about the monolith that is the trans experience. I wanted to make this as a hub
                of resources relating to trans healthcare, a dangerously frequently misunderstood area of medicine, as well
                as my experience transitioning such as what led me to transitioning, what the experience itself was like, what was hard, what was really rewarding,
                and my understanding of psychological what was happening to me in terms of identity and self understanding and where I am now. If you are
                questioning your gender and maybe even wonder if you are trans, please know there is nothing wrong with you, you have nothing to be ashamed of, and
                even if realize you aren't trans that is okay and just as valid as being trans. Seeking to better understand yourself is never a bad thing.

                Trans related medical information is decentralized and lots of information and guides, especially about niche topics, are not easily found
                and are shared within groups and communities. As such, <br>
                <em><strong>BY NO MEANS IS THIS COMPREHENSIVE</strong></em><br>
                comprehensive guides I like that include more general information can be found on the links page

                What it means to be <em>transgender</em> does not have a universally accepted definition between researchers. Its a really complicated
                topic and is tied to tons of culture and that complicates things a lot.<br> <span class = "toolTip">Being transgender<span class = "toolTipText">I'm not
                  going to use a term like <em>transgenderism</em> because its derogatory/has an extremely negative conotation
                  and isn't used in literature or anything</span></span> is a general term that does have a commonly agreed upon general definition: the state of one's
                  gender identity not aligning the sex that was assigned to them at birth. So for example, someone can be recorded as being male when they are born but go
                  on to reject that and instead decide or come to the realization that they are actually a woman. A trans person that was recorded as being male or female when born is typically referred to
                  as AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) or AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth) respectively; however, for the rest of this guide I'm going to use the designation
                  Presumed instead of Assigned as I think its more accurate (so PMAB instead of AMAB or PFAB instead of AFAB), but it is essentially the same thing.

                There are tons of ideas about the nuance of a person being transgender or who is trans and who isn't or whats required to have that label etc etc. I will get
                into all of these later but they aren't important right now.
                I will define who is and isn't trans using the criteria that the <span class="toolTip">American Pychiatric association <span class="toolTipText">Being trans is <strong>not</strong> a mental illness and hasn't been considered one for a while however the APA and affiliated researchers do lead research in the field still</span></span> uses <a href = "https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria">here:</a>

                  The term “transgender” refers to a person whose sex assigned at birth (i.e. the sex assigned at birth, usually based on external genitalia) does not align their gender identity (i.e., one’s psychological sense of their gender). Some people who are transgender will experience “gender dysphoria,” which refers to psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity

                A person who is trans typically transitions to the gender or gender expression they feel best suits them. Transition (this process of transitioning) is super multifaceted and includes two main types of changes: social and medical.
                Social transition is changes a person makes to what clothes they wear or their name or what pronouns they want people to use to refer to them, and medical transition is changes a person fundamentally makes to their body like taking hormones or surgery.
                Transition is <strong>not</strong> one size fits all. Some people might not change their name. Some might not get surgery. Some might choose to not transition medically and only transition socially. None of these are inherently wrong. People just want different things
                and thats okay.

                People are motivated to transition for a lot of reasons. One of the main ones is Gender Dysphoria. This is
