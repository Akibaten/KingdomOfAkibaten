              Jade is a pothos that was given to me by a friend. She is HUGE. She has about 6 major vines, and the biggest vine is over 4 feet long! By species she is a golden pothos technically, but within the speceis there are many different types of pothos which have been selectively bred to have certain colors, patterns or sometimes even different leaf shapes. These different types are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar">cultivars</a> the <a href="/img/plants/pothos varieties.jpg">jade pothos</a> is a type of golden pothos that lacks variegation. I have her climbing up the sides of my window right now so she can get tons and tons of light :3

              I got Persephone from a local nursery. She is absolutely gorgeous. Coleus plants have incredibly interesting variegation. The variegation (its pattern) and the color of a coleus is decided by light levels. Red coloration is from production of anthocyanins, and this occurs when the coleus is stressed from too much light. Anthocyanins work as a natural UV protector for the leaves that stops them from getting sunburned. So if a coleus is in the shade its leaves will be primarily green, and if its in direct sunlight, its leaves will slowly shift towards primarily red.

              Athena is my marble queen pothos which is another one golden pothos cultivars I mentioned in my description for Jade. Athena is new to me, but she is so so so pretty. I felt like Athen was the <em>perfect</em> name for her just given how bold she looks. She is finally one I can hang in my room, and I feel like she really brings the place together :) This gives me a chance to give more facts about Pothos. Pothos <em>very</em> rarely flower, sexually reproduce, and fruit. There's a myth that the last time flowering was seen in a plant from the genus Epipremnum was in 1964, but I can't find anything that actually supports this claim. Modern day houseplant pothos just have a mutation that prevents them from flowering. Different cultivars/types of pothos come from random mutations in the same pothos instead of sexual reproduction which is how we normally selectively breed (like selecting the biggest corn to reproduce so we get huge corn plants or seedless bananas). Because pothos lack the gene to flower and sexually reproduce, it is fair to say that a large large large majority of all the pothos you see in people's houses or even in the wild are the SAME plant! Isn't that crazy? they are all just the same plant having a vine cut off, propagating and growing a new plant. This means that outside of random genetic mutations almost all pothos are genetically identical and from the same couple of plants that could be hundreds of years old.

              Juno is my monstera! They are actually getting pretty big now! They recently unfurled a leaf that was just beautiful :o Monsteras are fascinating plants. I could talk about them forever. <em>Monstera deliciosa</em>, despite being pretty big compared to other climbing plants they are still climbers and will climb up trees, trellises, etc. The genus <em>Monstera</em> actual has several species that are pretty small and vine-y. The most common is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstera_adansonii"><em>Monstera adansonii</em></a>. The key trait that makes Monstera identifiable is the holes in their leaves called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforate_leaf">fenestrations</a>. We don't know exactly why these fenestrations exist. It might be to make leaves less likely to get ripped apart by winds or maybe to let water fall to the roots of the plant, but they are still quite unique looking and can be quite pretty. <span class = "tooltip">here<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src = "/img/plants/junoNewLeaf.JPG"></span></span> is a leaf my monstera recently unfurled that I thought was quite pretty. <em>Monstera deliciosa</em> are quite special because they can fruit! They fruit so easily you can do it at home, and supposedly the fruit is super tasty <span class = "tooltip">here<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src= "/img/plants/monsteraFruit.png"></span></span> is a picture of a guy picking and eating its fruit!

              Ceres is my aglaonema! Aglaonema's are angiosperms and like all angiosperms (pothos, monstera, tulips, corn, so so many etc) it produces fruit which scientifically is just a fertilized ovary that becomes a thing that has seeds and disperses them somehow. Aglaonema fruits are poisonous, but they are still quite <span class = "tooltip">pretty<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src = "/img/plants/aglaonemaFruit.jpg"></span></span>. Aglaonemas also can have extremely pretty foliage ranging from <span class = "tooltip">pink<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src = "/img/plants/pinkAglaonema.webp"></span></span> to <span class = "tooltip">red<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src = "/img/plants/redAglaonema.webp"></span></span> to <span class = "tooltip">silver<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src = "/img/plants/silverQueenAglaonema.jpg"></span></span> to this super cool <span class = "tooltip">tricolor camoflauge<span class = "tooltiptext"><img src = "/img/plants/tricolorAglaonema.webp"></span></span> pattern.

            <p>
              Hermes is my silver stripe (I think) Philodendron! Right now he is really small because I grew him from a cutting. One day I was in a glasses store getting my glasses adjusted, and I noticed and asked about the philo they had. It was SUPER long, easily 10 feet in some vines. The guy working there was super super nice and offered to give me a cutting! That was very sweet of him. Unfortunately, lately Hermes' growth has really stalled. I'm not sure why. I propagated him in water and potted him. He was growing before the potting so I'm not really sure :/ I'm considering cutting him up and reprogated as maybe 4 smaller plants, and then potting him again. Philodendrons are also a super cool and extremely varied Genus, but I'll write about them more when I get him in a better spot :)
