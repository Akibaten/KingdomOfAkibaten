          KERO KERO BONITO
        </h1>
        <p>
          Kero Kero Bonito is a trio consisting of Sarah Bonito (Sarah Midori Perry), Gus Bonito (Gus Lobban), and Jamie Bulled. While KKB was originally Gus's project, in 2012 Gus and Jamie posted to the forum MixB looking for a Japanese speaking vocalist and Sarah Bonito was one of the first people to respond! They released their first work together, Intro Bonito, in September of 2013. Since then their original computer-y, wacky sound has morphed and evolved in so many ways and directions from bubblegum pop to noise rock to more techno inspired work. They always sound new and different, but always sound like <em>them</em>.

          I first came upon Kero Kero Bonito in 2018 when I saw a music review for their album <em>Time 'n' Place</em>. I instantly fell in love with it. I was young and it felt like one of my first forays into developing my own music taste. I listened to it non stop for months until I thought to maybe check out their other two albums at the time, <em>Intro Bonito</em> and <em>Bonito Generation</em>. These were <strong>completely</strong> different than <em>Time 'n' Place</em>, but to my surprise I fell in love with them just the same way. For a majority of my life I think I have just felt like an amorphous creature. I discovered Kero Kero Bonito during a really formative time in my life when I didn't really know who I was. I gained so much respect for them just as artists and people.They really challenged what I thought it meant to be an <em>artist</em> and made me realize that your art isn't just what you create, it extends to your whole existence as a person. Seeing Sarah Bonito was one of the first times I ever someone's style and existence and thought to myself "I want to be <em>that</em>".

          Intro Bonito released 30 September 2013
        </h2>
        <p>
          KKB's first album! althought technically it is considered to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtape"><em>mixtape</em></a> by KKB themselves. This album heavily uses samplers and all keyboards in a way I've never seen. Drums, synths, random FX sounds, all of it comes from keyboards, and instead of such preset sounds limiting the music, it gives the album so much life and such a unique vibe. It feels like I am listening to a personification of the cutesy, disorganized, and personalized indie webistes in 2013.

          Bonito Generation released 21 October 2016
        </h2>
        <p>
          KKB's sophomore album! This album has the same over the top bubbly, bright, colorful vibe of Intro Bonito, but the production of the album is quite different. It's production is much more modern, polished, and twinkly. There is lots of ambience in the back of tracks, modern sounding drums, and synth sounds that come from modern plugins. The overall feeling of the album is much more energetic than it's predecessor, and nearly every song has a beat and movement to its melodies that feels as that its encouraging you to bounce your head to it as opposed to just nod along with it. Bonito Generation has several music videos: Lipslap, Break, and Trampoline.

          TOTEP released 20 February 2018
        </h2>
        <p>
          TOTEP marked an absolutely massive turn in KKB's sound. Instead of the bubbly, bubblegum pop sound of both Intro Bonito and Bonito Generation, the sound of this album is noisy, grungey,and very guitar heavy. It has this dreamy, flowing vibe that makes it border on the edge of dream pop if it were any less noisy. The vocal performances of Sarah Bonito range from powerful in The One True Path to dreamy and wistful in Cinema.

          This is my favorite Kero Kero Bonito album. It was my introduction to KKB, and at the time, I had never heard anything like it. The album was born out of KKB wanting to do whatever they wanted regardless of what people <em>thought</em> KKB was. In it's content and writing, it was influenced by Gus Bonito recalling visiting his hospitalized father and Sarah Bonito learning her childhood home in Japan had been demolished. Outside is one of if not the best intro track for an album I have ever heard. This album mainly somewhat follows the outline of sound present in TOTEP but more fleshed out. It even shares a song with TOTEP (Only Acting). The guitars are heavy. The vocals are dreamy. The drums range from punchy, noisy, and distorted to electronic with the same bouncy feeling as in Bonito Generation albeit in a very different context. It is entirely different than any previous major release, and yet, it still sounds <em>distinctly</em> KKB. Gus Bonito absolutely killed it with this album. The production is truly stellar. Twinkly, shoegaze-y, noisy, dreamy, unique, it is so innovative and feels like a unique combination of several genre's that I had only ever listened to in isolation. It's sound reminds me a lot of a wistful, somewhat hopeful rendition of Sweet Trip and My Bloody Valentine. Just as this album begins abruptly and noisy, it ends the same way. I think I have had an individual obsession with almost every song in this album. I imagine if you had asked me my favorite tracks when I first heard the album, my list would be quite different. I could rant about this album forever. There are several music videos for this album: Time Today, Only Acting, Make Believe, and Swimming. Every one is a personification of the dreamy feeling of the album. Time Today and Only Acting have a desolate, odd, backrooms feel, Make Believe and Flyway have a dreamy montage like feeling that makes me feel like I have randomly come across some 15 year old montage of some random person's memories on an old camera, and Swimming feels vast, open, and somewhat desolate and dreamy. Flyway in particular gives me goosebumps and just feels so <em>authentic</em> in a way that's tough for me to describe.

        <h2>
          Civilization
        </h2>
        <p>
          Civilization is another complete departure from previous sounds from KKB. This album is actually a sequential compilation of two EPs, Civilization I and Civilization II with an added track, Gateway, between, although Gateway is not included in the physical release. There is a stark difference between the first and second half of the album. The first half is dreamy, twinkly, clean, and organic sounding. Despite being somewhat dreamy, the drums and rhythms feel grounded and natural with use of electronic samples of instruments like bongos, toms, and wood blocks. It feels spiritual and almost psychedelic in an interesting way. Thematically it focuses on the global warmiing and the environmental crisis as well as critiquing our current government systems for addressing an issue of such great importance. The second half of the album is much more modern sounding with the energetic, blazing synths in The Princess and The Clock and poppy vocals in both The Princess and The Clock and 21/04/20. Despite the two more poppy songs at the beginning of the second half, the last song of the album, Well Rested, is a complete 180 back to the sound of the first half of the album. It is filled with chants and vocals that cry out broken up by serious monologues speaking directly to the listener. The production is hypnotic. Its repetition feels like it puts you into a trance. It is the longest KKB song to date, and is the first time Japanese has been sung in a KKB song since Bonito Generation. It ends beautifully and gently. It also contains an AMAZING acid bass solo that I love to pieces. There are several music videos for this album: When The Fires Come, The Princess And The Clock, and Well Rested. Each MV is extremely aesthetic and says so much, and makes me feel many feelings. When The Fires Come in particular is like a KKB rendition of Mad Max which is a combination that had never crossed my mind in the slightest.
