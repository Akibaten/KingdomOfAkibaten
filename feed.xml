      <title> A hot fix... sort of version: Ì.𝚭.Ⴢ.§</title>
      <description> In my last push I kind of destroyed my RSS widget. I just couldn't stand for that it really killed me lol. So I spent a ton of time... hours... figuring out how to write my own rss widget. I was trying to use javascript like a noob. I didn't know xlst existed to auto format xml its so awesome THANK YOU W3. This isn't a hotfix in that its small and meant to fix things. It fixes things by changing a lot so its like a regular smallish update done "hot"-ly I guess.
Changelog:
-changed font to trebuchet (tbh the pixely one was getting obnoxious, it isn't websafe or standard so it was so hard to use with xls, and most importantly IT WAS DESTROYING MY KAOMOJIs :((( so I just decided to change it. I had meant to do this anyway)
-removed php rss widget
-created XLS to format XML and display in an object element
-I think thats it

      <title>New Background</title>
      <description>I have finally added a different background :D the old one was quite slow and a bit too much. This visual was made in p5js! I designed it kind of inspired by https://ramcst.neocities.org/ please check him out! its a really cool site. I initially loaded p5js but there were tons of rendering issues and it was very resource intensive. I refined it a lot and then just took a video of it and put that in the site instead :P so no p5js is running. Imagine my shock when I d for free accounts :( after all that work :((( so I just caved and got supporter c: i love neocities anyways I am happy to support. Let me know if this background is a lot overstimulating lol. I ha ve a lot of exams next week so I have to ban myself from working on this for a week or two :( its just insanely distracting I will sink so many hours into :/ Also I am really starting to realize the limitations of just manually pushing using CLI from a local directory so I might switch to github. I also started using visual studio. HUGE quality of life thing for sure. That's all! I hope this update finds you well! ^_^</description>

      <title>RSS Widget Added</title>
      <description>Okay I implemented it basically instantly. Javascript is far too slow at working with html. I have used a widget generator to make one for me in php which is nice. However... I wasted like 4 hours of life（；¬＿¬). Unfortunately neocities can't host php files so I have to hotlink and it might break later but oh well. Hopefully it all works now.</description>

      <title>FINALLY I ADDED RSS</title>
      <description>This was one of if not the hardest thingsgs I have ever coded. RSS is actually fairly easy to implement. I fdon't have supporter so I had to come up with some work arounds where I could manually push to neocities from local files. For some reason, after this I decided to basically build my own rss widget in javascript and it was insanely hard to put it lightly. I spent 4 hours and it barely works and I still need to implement it on the websitite. I'm considering making a tutorial for all of this because I had to go to 100 different resources just to figure it out. ANYWAYS thats all ^-^</description>
