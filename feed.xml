      <title>New Background</title>
      <description>I have finally added a different background :D the old one was quite slow and a bit too much. This visual was made in p5js! I designed it kind of inspired by https://ramcst.neocities.org/ please check him out! its a really cool site. I initially loaded p5js but there were tons of rendering issues and it was very resource intensive. I refined it a lot and then just took a video of it and put that in the site instead :P so no p5js is running. Imagine my shock when I d for free accounts :( after all that work :((( so I just caved and got supporter c: i love neocities anyways I am happy to support. Let me know if this background is a lot overstimulating lol. I ha ve a lot of exams next week so I have to ban myself from working on this for a week or two :( its just insanely distracting I will sink so many hours into :/ Also I am really starting to realize the limitations of just manually pushing using CLI from a local directory so I might switch to github. I also started using visual studio. HUGE quality of life thing for sure. That's all! I hope this update finds you well! ^_^</description>

      <title>RSS Widget Added</title>
      <description>Okay I implemented it basically instantly. Javascript is far too slow at working with html. I have used a widget generator to make one for me in php which is nice. However... I wasted like 4 hours of life（；¬＿¬). Unfortunately neocities can't host php files so I have to hotlink and it might break later but oh well. Hopefully it all works now.</description>

      <title>FINALLY I ADDED RSS</title>
      <description>This was one of if not the hardest thingsgs I have ever coded. RSS is actually fairly easy to implement. I fdon't have supporter so I had to come up with some work arounds where I could manually push to neocities from local files. For some reason, after this I decided to basically build my own rss widget in javascript and it was insanely hard to put it lightly. I spent 4 hours and it barely works and I still need to implement it on the websitite. I'm considering making a tutorial for all of this because I had to go to 100 different resources just to figure it out. ANYWAYS thats all ^-^</description>
