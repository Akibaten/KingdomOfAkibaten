# My Experience with Vyvanse (Lisdexamphetamine)

## Background
I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I suppose I had this as a child, but it wasn't really noticeable then as odd as that sounds. I did well in High school and graduated salutatorian, but when I got to college things really changed. I retook many classes as I was originally pre-med, and when I was taking classes on material I already knew it went quite well. However, as soon as I got to new material, things really started falling apart. I became quite depressed and began failing classes. Even after I got my mental health treated I still was unable to focus, study, or do much of anything. When I got diagnosed with ADHD I guess it made sense to me. I was constantly late, it took me hours to get ready or really start any task, I spoke ad nauseam constantly without thinking, etc etc. I thought this was just because I was weird or something. After the diagnosis, I had to go through multiple tests and several doctors before I was finally given the amphetamine medication Vyvanse (Lisdexamphetamine).

## Starting Vyvanse
When I started Vyvanse I felt it kick in within about an hour. There was a weird calmness that overtook me. It felt like there was finally very little or no noise in my brain. My thoughts became deliberate and followed reasonable continuous lines. It was truly phenomenal. One of the best feelings ever. Additionally, I felt a calm euphoria, a sort of warmness at the back of my neck. This faded after a couple of days, but it was not necessarily disagreeable when it happened. Feeling it kick in became kind of satisfying in an odd way. After my first class of the day, I sat down and began coding my website, and everything instantly felt insanely rewarding. I was able to work without a break for a few hours without issue. This sort of hyperfocus that stopped me from even getting up to use the restroom did eventually become a problem, but was such an insane break from the usual that it felt more like an issue of me being able to control it than it did seem an actual issue with the medication. As the days went on the more subtle benefits of the medication became more and more apparent. I found myself, when considering whether or not to procrastinate something, just *choosing* not to? This was an insane break from the usual. I found myself, when walking to the library, just walking to the library. When I studied, the timers I used to set to painfully force me to continuously try to study no longer felt like a horrific taskmaster imprisoning me but a friend gently letting me know I needed to take a break, and oftentimes because I was so focused, I would just ignore them. I hope this hyperfocus becomes more manageable over time, and I believe it will as it has already improved.

## Why This Works

This has given me an opportunity to talk about one of my favorite mechanisms of action of any drug. First I should establish that vyvanse is an amphetamine and is a prodrug of amphetamine (adderall [technically adderall is dextroamphetamine and the chirality of vyvanse after conversion could be racemic but whatever thats not super important]). It is essentially adderall with an additional lysine amino acid on the end of it. This means that your body has to cleave this lysine molecule (turning it into amphetamine) before it can actually use Vyvanse in your brain.

This cleaving is hugely advantageous to Vyvanse because it increases it's halflife (essentially how long it can actually be effective in your brain)

Now you might ask then, how does amphetamine work in your brain? This is where things get *truly* interesting. As it turns out amphetamine works through several mechanisms in Dopamine and norepinephrine using neurons. Including reuptake inhibition and through increasing the number of neurotransmitter molecules inside the cell (this is the actual interesting one). First, it must be understood how a neuron works specifically a dopamine neuron. In a neuron, there is the soma (the big bit at the beginning including all the important cell bits), an axon (a tail that leads to another neuron), a small gap between the end of the axon and the beginning of the next neuron (this is called the synaptic cleft). A dopamine neuron works by creating a little bubble called a vesicle and putting dopamine in it in the soma, sending this bubble down the axon, and whenever an electrical impulse flows through the neuron, this little bubble gets absorbed by the end of the axon and the dopamine molecules get released into the synaptic cleft and bind to the next neuron and stimulate it.
How does this relate to amphetamine? Amphetamine is absorbed by the neuron and attaches itself to an enzyme (kind of a tool in a way) that is used to create these little vesicles. This means that instead of these dopamine molecules getting put in little bubbles and sent down the axon, they just float around and naturally find themselves at the end of the axon. Whenever the neuron is then stimulated, the little pumps used to push out these vesicles into the synaptic cleft push out tons of dopamine instead of these little, pre-divided sets of neurons. Imagine if you were shooting a semi-automatic gun (I know an extremely American analogy). Typically you would expect to fire a single bullet when you pull the trigger once, but instead, whenever you pull the trigger it fires a far larger burst of bullets. This is a huge part of how amphetamine works. It makes reward circuitry and circuitry used for focus in your brain much more active than they would usually be. This is why it is often abused. More information can be learned abou this through this article if you are interested although the wordage used gets pretty academic: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556103/#:~:text=Go%20to%3A-,Mechanism%20of%20Action,through%20a%20variety%20of%20mechanisms.
This is a pretty oversimplified explanation but is *basically* how it works.

## conclusion
I'll update with how things go in the future, but I think that's all for now. Thank you for listening to me rant about something I think is cool. This was so cool I might actually begin a tab on my page to talk about drugs I think are cool and their mechanisms of action. That's all for now (^_^)
