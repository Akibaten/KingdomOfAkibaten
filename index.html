                  Hello ^_^<br>
                  My name is Sarah. I use the name akibaten in most places.<br>
                  I love being creative, but I really struggle to create full, cohesive, completed works. This site is my attempt
                  to combat that. I create a lot (or at least I try to), and for so long, everything I made has been more or less ephemeral.
                  Poetry lost in journals or songs played once in a dj set and never again or drawings stashed in forgotten sketchbooks. I think
                  a part of me is scared of being judged or scared of being looked at. On this site I can kind of just put anything I want without
                  constantly judging myself (or less so than I would otherwise). When I do this, the site and my art kind of grow with me in a big
                  cohesive project that's really just <em>me</em>. So when I am proud of something, instead of waiting because I want it to be a part
                  of some huge project that might not materialize, I can just put it here.

                      stuff between 2008 and 2014 or so, I've rarely if ever found anything like it. His discography is pretty scattered, but surprisingly most of his

                      A really special math rock band. Everything is so powerful. The drums don't feel awkward, and yet they are unpredictable. The guitar work is truly the most beautiful.
                      I have ever heard in math rock up there with Ivette Young, and the vocals always give me goosebumps all over my body and make me feel like that moment is one of the most
                      important moments of my life. They are truly amazing. I actually went to the cafe in kyouto that is owned by the guitarist of this band, and it was pretty good. Their music
                      can be found most places you find music. Here is their <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/2DZe9zw4ZNgEFPA8vRMade?si=3I0yv6G3QAC9OfZ0pJCnog">Spotify</a>

                      Inside Mari by Shuzo Oshimi
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                      Inside Mari is a manga about a really existentially lost guy that one day wakes up in the body of a girl. It begins as a mystery as he searches for
                      why this happened, but quickly becomes much more complicated and psychological. I can't say anymore without spoiling stuff so you have to read it ;) It helped me
                      figure out who I was and taught me a lot about identity not just as an abstract concept but a lens through which we see the world and understand ourselves, and as
                      cringe as it feels to say, it kind of... healed a part of me.

                      The End of Evangelion is my favorite movie of all time. It's so powerful, and when I watched it for the first time I felt every idea and concept it showed interface
                      with my soul in a way thats hard to describe. It is the perfect end to any piece of media I've ever watched and does an incredible job of exploring idas about
                      spirituality and the concept of a system/outcome/chain of events being perfectly imperfect.

                      Another movie I love to death. Its a heart-wrenching watch, but it portrays so much and says so much. In writing this right now I realize sometimes its okay to not
                      abstract some thing we love so we can explain why we like it. I like this movie because I can <em>feel</em> it. The imagery, emotions, writing... it all hits my brain
                      in such a beautiful way and tumbles down all the paths of my feelings in such a unique way I haven't felt it anywhere else.

                    <p>
                      Beautiful, electronic album about a girl loving her computer. Made by Ninajirachi who is an incredibly talented producer. I believe this sort of dance music,
                      a vocalist and individual producer where an album has overarching aesthetics over drawn out atmosphere and ambience in individual songs, is the future of dance music.
