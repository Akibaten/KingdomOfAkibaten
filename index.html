                  Hello ^_^<br>
                  My name is Sarah. I use the name akibaten in most places.<br>
                  I love being creative, but I really struggle to create full, cohesive, completed works. This site is my attempt
                  to combat that. I create a lot (or at least I try to), and for so long, everything I made has been more or less ephemeral.
                  Poetry lost in journals or songs played once in a dj set and never again or drawings stashed in forgotten sketchbooks. I think
                  a part of me is scared of being judged or scared of being looked at. On this site I can kind of just put anything I want without
                  constantly judging myself (or less so than I would otherwise). When I do this, the site and my art kind of grow with me in a big
                  cohesive project that's really just <em>me</em>. So when I am proud of something, instead of waiting because I want it to be a part
                  of some huge project that might not materialize, I can just put it here.
                  <!-- Hi! <br> My name is Sarah<br> ♡⸜(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)⸝♡ <br>
                  I created this site as a personal project. I think social media has a great capacity to connect people and do good, but it's become
                    pretty exhausting these days >_&lt;. I think it's begun to divide us and push us to dehumanize ourselves and others by reducing us to 
                    arbitrary metrics. As a person who really values doing creative stuff, this site allows me to post and share my works, create a creative
                    work in the process, and free me from unconsciously changing who I am and my art. I still do have social media though, I just don't use it
                    very often. Here is my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/akibaten/">instagram</a>:P <br>
                    I love music and art and human expression and any method by which we are able to do that. All of my music can be found at my soundcloud link to the side.
                    Thank you for checking this out and enjoy your stay!<br>
                    ^_^

                      stuff between 2008 and 2014 or so, I've rarely if ever found anything like it. His discography is pretty scattered, but surprisingly most of his

                      A really special math rock band. Everything is so powerful. The drums don't feel awkward, and yet they are unpredictable. The guitar work is truly the most beautiful.
                      I have ever heard in math rock up there with Ivette Young, and the vocals always give me goosebumps all over my body and make me feel like that moment is one of the most
                      important moments of my life. They are truly amazing. I actually went to the cafe in kyouto that is owned by the guitarist of this band, and it was pretty good. Their music

                      Inside Mari by Shuzo Oshimi
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                      Inside Mari is a manga about a really existentially lost guy that one day wakes up in the body of a girl. It begins as a mystery as he searches for
                      why this happened, but quickly becomes much more complicated and psychological. I can't say anymore without spoiling stuff so you have to read it ;) It helped me
                      figure out who I was and taught me a lot about identity not just as an abstract concept but a lens through which we see the world and understand ourselves, and as
                      cringe as it feels to say, it kind of... healed a part of me.

                      The End of Evangelion is my favorite movie of all time. It's so powerful, and when I watched it for the first time I felt every idea and concept it showed interface
                      with my soul in a way thats hard to describe. It is the perfect end to any piece of media I've ever watched and does an incredible job of exploring idas about
                      spirituality and the concept of a system/outcome/chain of events being perfectly imperfect.

                      Another movie I love to death. Its a heart-wrenching watch, but it portrays so much and says so much. In writing this right now I realize sometimes its okay to not
                      abstract some thing we love so we can explain why we like it. I like this movie because I can <em>feel</em> it. The imagery, emotions, writing... it all hits my brain
                      in such a beautiful way and tumbles down all the paths of my feelings in such a unique way I haven't felt it anywhere else.

              The Importance of Existence

            <p style = "text-indent: 1em; margin-top: 4vh">
              Existence is so weird and confusing, and infinitely complex for every person, and I feel like if I struggle to make big projects or albums, maybe that's because I should try to make my whole existence a project in it of itself.
              I'm not sure there could be a project that could be bigger than that, or at least not one I can make by my lonesome.
            </p>
            <p style = "text-align: right; text-indent: 1em;">
              I've always tried to push myself to never have a filter about what I do and don't talk about with relation to myself. I think recently
              I have started to internalize that it is okay for me to have stuff in my brain just for me, but even still those things are pretty rare.
            </p>
            <p  style = "text-indent: 1em;">
              This website is about as <em>me</em> as I can possibly be publicly. We all have so much life we need to live, and I hope people perusing
              my existence will make someone as happy as perusing other people's inner worlds makes me.
