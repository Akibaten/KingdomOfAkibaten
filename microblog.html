            <strong>30-03-2025</strong> I've decided I'm going to start a microblog. I really like the idea of just being able to make a small little thing thats untitled and to not really have any pressure surrounding it.
            I decided to first make this because I saw  <a href = "https://aegi.neocities.org/digitalgarden/notes/dailylog">microblog</a>. I loved the formatting, the idea (obviously they didn't come up with it but still),
            and the person's voice in the writing just felt really soft, and I love that. On the same website I read <a href = "https://aegi.neocities.org/digitalgarden/notes/thedustytoolbox">this</a> page, and it filled me with a lot of
            hope. I recently made a set I was really happy with for an event. I made so much music working like 8 hours a day or something for 3-4 days. I was so proud of the project not because it was perfect but because
            it had purpose and direction which is something I had strived for for so long but had always felt out of reach. After that I have been thinking about making that set into an album, but alas, music has once again become
            difficult again >w< It's so tough to constantly feel like you are searching for yourself and your art, but maybe I need to stop thinking that I am searching for myself. I haven't gone anywhere. I'm right here :P I think I just
            want my art to be a certain thing. I want it to be <i>this</i> good or I want it to sound like <i>this</i>, and instead of admitting to myself that that's not realistic or even if I were to achieve it it would inherently not be
            as good as it could've been (given that I am me and they are them and we are different), I just constantly intimidate myself and never feel good enough. But my art doesn't have to be anything but mine y'know? It's tough to 
            struggle with something especially when you know the answer, and it's really simple. I find it really frustrating and disheartening, but I will try to work through it anyways.
