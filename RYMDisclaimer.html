      I only use RateYourMusic to catalog what I've listened to and what my thoughts are about it.
      I do not find it useful to evaluate what people think about music generally speaking. RateYourMusic is
      remarkably biased against certain types of music because of culture, history, and subsequently the type of people
      motivated to actively use it. Some of my most favorite pieces of music have worse reviews than any Radiohead album
      (most of which I do not find enjoyable or vibe with in the slightest). Understanding that, if you still want to see
      please keep an open mind for the pieces I catalog all music is deserving of love and respect, and the world is a better
      place with these pieces of music in it regardless of what I think of them. -`♡´-
